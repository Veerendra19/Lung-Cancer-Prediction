# Lung-Cancer-Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of lung cancer using various machine learning models. By analyzing key health indicators and risk factors, the models can help in early detection, improving chances for timely medical intervention.

## Dataset
The dataset includes several features related to patient health conditions, such as:

Age
Smoking habits
Air pollution exposure
Genetic history
Other relevant health indicators

## Models Implemented
The following machine learning models were used for prediction:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Decision Tree
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and handling missing values
2. Feature Engineering: Selecting important features
3. Model Training: Training multiple ML models
4. Evaluation: Comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
5. Results Visualization: Graphical representation of predictions

## Installation & Usage
